  <h1>Breakout+ Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Effective date: February 5, 2026</p>

  <p>
    Breakout+ is an offline game. It stores settings and scores locally on your device
    and does not require an account. The app does not include third-party analytics and
    does not transmit gameplay data to external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Stored On Device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Settings (sound, music, vibration, sensitivity, refresh-rate preference)</li>
    <li>Scoreboard entries (player name, score, mode, level, duration)</li>
    <li>Optional gameplay logs (only if “Enable Game Logging” is turned on)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Logging</h2>
  <p>
    If game logging is enabled, gameplay events are written to files stored locally on your
    device. These logs are not uploaded or shared.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Breakout+ does not sell, share, or transmit your data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>
    If this policy changes, the update will be reflected in the app and in the Play Store listing.
    In-app policy text is kept in sync with the app’s local privacy policy.
