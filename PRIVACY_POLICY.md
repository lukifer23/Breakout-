# Breakout+ Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 5, 2026

Breakout+ is an offline game. It stores settings and scores locally on your device and does not require an account. The app does not include third‑party analytics and does not transmit gameplay data to external servers.

## Data Stored On Device
- Settings (sound, music, vibration, sensitivity, refresh‑rate preference)
- Scoreboard entries (player name, score, mode, level, duration)
- Optional gameplay logs (only if “Enable Game Logging” is turned on)

## Logging
If game logging is enabled, gameplay events are written to files stored locally on your device. These logs are not uploaded or shared.

## Data Sharing
Breakout+ does not sell, share, or transmit your data to third parties.

## Changes
If this policy changes, the update will be reflected in the app and in the Play Store listing. In-app policy text is kept in sync with this document (`app/src/main/res/raw/privacy_policy.txt`).
